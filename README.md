# Data-Manipulation
In this project, I used the market survey dataset where respondents were asked whether Acer or Sony is their preferred computer brand. I utilized data manipulation commands to provide an organized and easier to read data.
In mysql workbench, created a database named 'survey' and table named 'responses' then imported the data from the 'CompleteResponses' csv file. Since I will be using data manipulation techniques, I made another copy of the 'responses' table and named it as 'responses_v2'. This is the table I used in performing my queries.
The zip file 'responses_v2' contains the updated table 'responses_v2'.
